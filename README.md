# reviled-tkinter
A place to promote tk/tkinter as great OS-agnostic GUI toolkit

You can find throughout the network a multitude of articles and derogatory comments about tkinter (even people asking for their exclusion from default python package).

This repository aims to demonstrate precisely the opposite: Tkinter is a light, fast and extremely powerful tool for creating any type of graphic environment compatible with the most widespread desktop OS (Windows, Linux and MAC-OS)
